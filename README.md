The "C - Sorting algorithms & Big O" project is focused on sorting algorithms and the concept of Big O notation.

The project includes implementations of several common sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort. The performance of each algorithm is analyzed and compared using Big O notation, which describes the time complexity of an algorithm as a function of the input size.

The project also includes a brief overview of the different types of data structures that can be sorted, including arrays, and linked lists.

Overall, this project provides a solid foundation for understanding the basics of sorting algorithms and Big O notation, which are essential concepts for any programmer working with large datasets or complex systems.
